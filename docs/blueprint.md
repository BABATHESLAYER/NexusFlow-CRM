# **App Name**: TreeViz

## Core Features:

- Tree Construction: Allow users to define a binary tree structure by inputting nodes and their relationships. This can be done via a simple, intuitive interface.
- Traversal Animation: Animate the non-recursive inorder traversal of the binary tree, highlighting the current node being visited and the stack's contents at each step.
- Step-by-Step Controls: Implement play, pause, next step, and previous step controls, so that users can fully control the animation for demonstration purposes.
- Code Tooltips: Explain the current traversal action by relating it to pseudocode for a non-recursive inorder traversal algorithm; present relevant code snippets in tooltips during each step of the animation using 'Source Code Pro' font. This tool will determine what information to incorporate.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#3F51B5) to represent the structured nature of trees and algorithms.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) for a clean and focused interface.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF9800) to highlight the currently processed node during traversal.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying code snippets.
